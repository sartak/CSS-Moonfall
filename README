CSS::Moonfall 0.03

Moonfall is a program for the dynamic generation of CSS. The problem it
solves is making CSS more programmable. The most basic usage is to define
variables within CSS (e.g., so similar elements can have their common color
defined in one and only one place). CSS::Moonfall aims to be a faithful port
from Lua to Perl.

See L<http://moonfall.org/> for more details.
